# ML workshop MolSim 2020

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kjappelbaum/ml_molsim2020.git/master?filepath=molsim_ml)

## Run it locally (recommended) 

```(bash) 
mkdir molsim_ml 
git clone https://github.com/kjappelbaum/ml_molsim2020.git
cd ml_molsim2020
jupyter notebook # or jupyter lab if you prefer
```
## Use it on MyBinder
It can take some time to build the instance and the computing resources are
limited. 

## Use it on Google CoLab 
Here, you can use relatively powerful computing resources from Google for free,
    but in contrast to MyBinder you need to manually install conda and the
    dependencies.
